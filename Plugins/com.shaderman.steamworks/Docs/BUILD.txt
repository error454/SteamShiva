- Get the Steamworks SDK from https://partner.steamgames.com
- Extract the content into the Plugins\com.shaderman.steamworks\Sources\Steamworks_SDK folder

Windows 32 bit:
- Copy steam_api.dll from Plugins\com.shaderman.steamworks\Sources\Steamworks_SDK\redistributable_bin to Plugins\com.shaderman.steamworks\Contents\Windows

Windows 64 bit:
- To be done

Mac 32 bit:
- Do not use the "Generate X-code project" option in the editor, this will destroy the correctly configured project file.
- Copy the com.shaderman.steamworks folder to Mac and open the xcode project in Make\Mac folder
- Build for 32-bit
- The result will be a newly built library: Contents\Mac\Steamworks_Mac.dylib
- In Shiva windows, in the mac section of the plugin, import the plugin binary and select the dylib that was generated.
- Now you can export the project for Mac
- If you are testing on the Mac and not through steam, after you build the project in the UAT, you'll need to create a steam_appid.txt in the program [Name].App/Contents/MacOS/ folder

Linux:
For linux you need to copy over the com.shaderman.steamworks folder, you then navigate to the Make/Linux folder and run make on the appropriate makefile from there.

Linux 32 bit:
* Use the Steamworks.makefile_x86 to build
  make -f Steamworks.makefile_x86
* If you are compiling on 64-bit linux, you may need to install necessary packages (see header of makefile).

Linux 64 bit:
* Use the Steamworks.makefile_x64 to build
  make -f Steamworks.makefile_x64

You will find the built linux library in the Contents/Linux folder. Now you need to copy this back to the windows side so you can export the plugin.

Make sure to grab the necessary libsteamapi.so from the *Steamworks_SDK/redistributable_bin*.
